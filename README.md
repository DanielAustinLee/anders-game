ANDERS GAME

----------------------------------------
This is my very first game!

At the moment there is no objective, you can move an oval across a green background, neat huh?!

----------------------------------------
TO DO:
----------------------------------------

 1. Fix player movement
	-Right now, the player can only move in cardinal directions (Up, down, left, right), but i want to at least make diagonal movement possible. The player likely needs to receive and process data from Input system differently

	
2. Continue entity system
	-Right now there is a single super class entity which player derives from. More should be added for enemies, bullets, items possibly

3. Get better at coding
	-My code looks like a monkey wrote it
