ANDERS GAME



----------------------------------------
TO DO:
----------------------------------------


	
1. Continue entity system
	-Right now there is a single super class entity which player derives from. More should be added for enemies, bullets, items possibly



2. Get better at coding
	-My code looks like a monkey wrote it


-----------------------------------------
DONE:
-----------------------------------------

 1. Fix player movement -- (DONE)
	-Right now, the player can only move in cardinal directions (Up, down, left, right), but i want to at least make diagonal movement possible. The player likely needs to receive and process data from Input system differently


2. Make camera move with player -- (DONE)
	-Player moves, camera is static. Next will be figuring out how to make camera movable
